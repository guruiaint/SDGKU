    <h2>Timeline</h2>
    <p>Alex grew up all over the country due to his father's United States Coast Guard career. After high school, and after a brief stint at traditional college, he decided to join the United States Air Force as a Security Forces Airman and was stationed at Malmstrom AFB in Great Falls, Montana.  It was at that time he married his spouse, Wendy.  When his enlistment ended he moved to Atlanta to be closer to his wife's friends and family and started attending school to become an HVAC technician.  As this was happening, his parents retired out west, Mother and Stepfather in the Phoenix area, Father in Las Vegas.  Upon completion of school and after some experience in his field, the family moved to Mesa, AZ and took a position in multifamily housing maintenance.  After some time in the field and dissapointed at the lack of mental challenge and financial benefits of his current profession, he decided to enroll in SDGKU to learn the fast paced and fast growing field of web design and software development.</p></main>
